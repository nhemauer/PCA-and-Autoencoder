# Dimensionality Reduction with PCA and Autoencoders

This repository contains PyTorch-based implementations of principal component analysis (PCA) and autoencoders for dimensionality reduction, reconstruction, and feature extraction tasks.

These models are tested and evaluated on the MNIST Numbers image dataset.

## What's Inside

- **PCA**  
  An implementation of principal component analysis (PCA).

- **Linear, Non-Linear, and Denoising Autoencoders**  
  Fully-connected neural autoencoders built with PyTorch. Used to compress and reconstruct high-dimensional images.
